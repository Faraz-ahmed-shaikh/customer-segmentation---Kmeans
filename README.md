# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering! ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š
In this project, I analyzed a shopping mall dataset to group customers based on Age, Gender, Annual Income, and Spending Score. </br>
</br>
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with : </br>
Age & Gender distribution, </br>
Average Spending Score by Gender, </br>
Average Income by Age Group. </br>
</br>
Finally, I used K-Means Clustering to identify distinct customer segments, helping businesses personalize marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.
